# gymnasium-planar-robotics
This library contains several reinforcement learning environments for planar robotics using the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) API. 
All environments are based on the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) physics engine. Note that this library depends on the latest MuJoCo python bindings. 
[mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py) is not supported.
